Projects i needed for academic purposes with some cool spectogram visulaization of my guitar cover of 4th of july.

## Techniques/Tools Used in This Project

- **Amplitude Spectrum**
- **Phase Spectrum**
- **Signal Envelopes**
- **Hamming, Hanning, Blackman, and Dirichlet Windows**, along with their amplitude spectra
- **Amplitude Spectrum of a Sinusoidal Signal** with three different frequencies using Hamming, Hanning, Blackman, and Dirichlet windows
- **Spectrum of a Sinusoidal Signal** using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- **Wavelet Types**: Haar, Daubechies, Symlets, Coiflets, Biorthogonal, Gaussian, Mexican Hat, Morlet
- **Decomposition of a Chirp Signal** using three different wavelets
- **Spectrograms**
- **Decomposition of a Chirp Signal** to determine the spectrum of each mode
- **Signal Denoising**
and some basic ui for most of the problems
